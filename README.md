# Geertsma
Matlab implementation of Geertsma's equation (Geerstma, 1973) for subsidence and inflation of a reservoir in a homgeneous medium. In-line syntax is described in  the comments. See the files for further documentation.

- 'Geertsma_Checklist': runs a quick check on the functions.

- 'Geertsma_Exact': calculates the vertical compaction on the line above and below a compacting disc

- 'Geertsma_Example': runs a numerical example, with some plot suggestions. 

- 'Geertsma_Symbolic_ToolBox': modeling function, with detailed explanation. Use this if you have the symbolic toolbox installed

- 'Geertsma_No_ToolBox': modeling function, with detailed explanation. Use this if you do not have the symbolic toolbox installed. Accuracy is slightly worse.

- Other functions are numerical implementations necessary in the absence of the Symbolic Toolbox.
